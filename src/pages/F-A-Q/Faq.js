                  <h4>2. Preparing recipes</h4>

                    <h5>Is the oven temperature in the recipes for electric, gas or convection?</h5>

                    <p>  I have an electric oven where I almost always use the top and bottom heat function (conventional). The temperatures in my recipes are therefore adjusted to this. I use this for casseroles, cakes, pizzas, etc. If you have a gas oven or if you use the convection function, reduce the temperature in the recipes by about 10%. Click here for a handy table. If you want to heat several layers/dishes in the oven, it is best to use the convection setting. This distributes the hot air evenly throughout the oven. I also have a grill in the oven that I sometimes turn on for the last few minutes with, for example, a gratin for an extra crispy crust.</p>

                    <h5>Do you also have recipes for special diets such as gluten-free, lactose-free, low-carb or sugar-free?</h5>

                    <p> I have a category on my site for gluten free recipes, low carb recipes and vegan recipes. Perhaps in the future there will be even more categories for dishes on a diet or eating method.</p>

                   <p> There are often alternatives available for recipes containing lactose. For example, you can replace milk with lactose-free milk such as soy milk, almond milk or rice milk and cooking cream with soy cream. I use regular refined sugar in almost all of my baking recipes. This can be replaced by, for example, palm sugar, agave syrup, coconut flower sugar, etc. Look here for the quantities.</p>

                    <h5>Are your recipes healthy?</h5>

                       <p>they are not all. But I do try to keep a good balance in mind. For example, I try to include enough vegetables in dishes and I use many fresh ingredients and I make many things myself. I have bundled recipes that contain many nutrients and are responsible in a Healthy recipes category. Please note, this does not mean that these recipes are always low in calories.</p>
