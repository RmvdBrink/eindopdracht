            <h5>sponsored content</h5>

            <p> With a number of articles you will see 'this is a sponsored post'. This means I got paid to write that article. I decide for myself which products, services and brands suit my site and which seem interesting to my visitors. The content of the sponsored articles is written by myself and I only write something if I stand behind the product and am excited about it myself. A large part of my income consists of these advertorials, which is why I can work full time on HealthyRecipes and offer my recipes for free.</p>
